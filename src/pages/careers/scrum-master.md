The Scrum Master is a servant-leader for the Scrum Team. The Scrum Master helps those outside the Scrum Team understand which of their interactions with the Scrum Team are helpful and which aren’t. The Scrum Master helps everyone change these interactions to maximize the value created by the Scrum Team. 

Help us foster great autonomous teams who own their work. Serve as the Scrum Master for one or two Scrum teams. Coach the Scrum teams and the broader organization to maximize the value created by the Scrum team and on highly effective inspection and adaptation practices. Be an active participant in andculture’s Scrum Master community.
