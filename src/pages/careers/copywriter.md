* Partner with a designer when developing copy that lives within design touchpoints or in a designed environment
* Consult with our strategy team for recommendations/direction on SEO & search approaches for online content
* Defend copywriting choices through articulated arguments and rationale
* Collaborate with account and creative teams, from concept development to delivery of final product
* Present copy concepts and final deliverables to creative lead and participate in client pitches on occasion (also in conjunction with engagement team, not just on assigned accounts)

**expectations**
* Thrive in a fast-paced, collaborative environment with a high-volume workload often requiring quick turnarounds
* Continually raise the bar on creativity, writing fresh copy that connects with the desired audience and drives action

* Ability to work independently and with a team to meet deadlines, remote or in-person
* Excellent organizational skill and multitasking ability
