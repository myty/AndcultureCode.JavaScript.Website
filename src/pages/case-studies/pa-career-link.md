heroIntroCopy: One of our values at andculture is vulnerability. And right now, it's time to be vulnerable. It goes without saying that the job market is in turmoil presently. While we (and many others) have transitioned to a fully remote environment to continue delivering for our client partners, we feel the anxiety of so many that find themselves in less fortunate circumstances. This is a time where we collectively need to support those that most desperately need a new way, a reality that will provide a path forward.
