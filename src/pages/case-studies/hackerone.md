heroIntroCopy: Every day seems to bring another headline about a data breach, malware or other security issue affecting companies who build software, people who use software and pretty much anyone on the internet. HackerOne’s clients stay a step ahead of cybercriminals by hiring and paying hackers to find security vulnerabilities before the bad guys do. Three cheers for the good guys!
