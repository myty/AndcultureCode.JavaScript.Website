heroIntroCopy: In a rapidly changing world, access to innovative, high-quality education remains a priority. And the  Commonwealth Charter Academy (CCA) gets that. They decided to partner with us one more time to create a platform that would provide a new and improved educational experience for students that focuses on providing successful learning outcomes. The andculture team behind CCA’s new project truly understands that every student learns differently, and created an experience that is uniquely tailored to each student.
