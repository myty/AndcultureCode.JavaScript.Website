heroIntroCopy: In a rapidly changing world, access to innovative, high-quality education remains a priority. And the  Commonwealth Charter Academy (CCA) gets that. They decided to partner with us one more time to create a platform that would provide a new and improved educational experience for students that focuses on providing successful learning outcomes. The andculture team behind CCAâ€™s new project truly understands that every student learns differently, and created an experience that is uniquely tailored to each student.
