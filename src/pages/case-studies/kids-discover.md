heroIntroCopy: In two decades, Kids Discover became well known for providing high-quality notification content for children in grades 3-8. With more than 200 magazine titles, each with 20 pages, Kids Discover was a treasure trove of iconic photographs, original illustrations, timelines and kid-friendly facts on hundreds of science and social studies topics. This all seems pretty awesome.
