                                <p>We agreed to have a preliminary splash page at first, then a basic site with space for events and media, and then, for the coup de grâce, a fully functioning site with content management capabilities. </p>
                                <p>Here’s what’s amazing: Because we listened to what families and staff needed and wanted, we could move forward with confidence as we prioritized and refined potential features. User flows (how you click through the site) were evaluated so we could be confident in the enrollment process. No charter school should lose a potential enrollment because your site hits a dead end or ends up being more trouble than it’s worth. This is where our partnership style shines through. We’re not just plugging things out and churning out the next step. We want to help you solve a problem.</p>
